import { useRef, useCallback } from 'react'

/**
 * This hook creates an internal copy of a `ref`
 * and returns a new `ref`-alike setter function
 * that updates both `ref` and the internal copy of it.
 * That `ref`-alike setter function could then be passed
 * to child elements instead of the original `ref`.
 *
 * The internal copy of the `ref` can then be used to
 * call instance methods like `.focus()`, etc.
 *
 * One may ask: why create a copy of `ref` for "internal" use
 * when the code could use the original `ref` for that.
 * The answer is: the code would have to dance around the original `ref` anyway
 * to figure out whether it exists and to find out the internal implementation of it
 * in order to read its value correctly. This hook encapsulates all that "boilerplate" code.
 * The returned copy of the `ref` is guaranteed to exist and functions as a proper ref "object".
 * The returned `ref`-alike setter function must be used instead of the original `ref`
 * when passing it to child elements.
 *
 * @param  {(object|function)} [externalRef] â€” The original `ref` that may have any internal implementation and might not even exist.
 * @return {any[]} Returns an array of two elements: a copy of the `ref` for "internal" use and a `ref`-alike setter function that should be used in-place of the original `ref` when passing it to child elements.
